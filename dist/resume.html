                <h1>Professional Profile</h1>
                <p>After graduating college I began my career by working in the energy sector. I became an engineer working all over North America for various energy companies. After a few years of doing this I was put on a project that involved some light programming work. I really enjoyed it. From there, I started teaching myself to program in my spare time. In 2015 I decided to take some time off work and attend a coding bootcamp to further my understanding. I enjoyed it, met some good people, and learned some useful skills. From there I learned Ruby on Rails, and started learning Javascript and front end tech. I'm several years in now, have a passion for development, and am looking to make it a full time job.</p>
